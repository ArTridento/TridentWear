# TridentWear — Production Checklist

Use this checklist before every production deployment.
Mark each item as done before going live.

- [ ] Order confirmation email tested by placing a test order

---

## 🌐 Domain & HTTPS

- [ ] HTTPS certificate installed (Let's Encrypt via certbot)
- [ ] HTTP → HTTPS redirect working
- [ ] WWW → non-WWW (or vice versa) redirect working
- [ ] SSL certificate auto-renewal confirmed (`certbot renew --dry-run`)

---

## 🗃️ Database

- [ ] `db/` directory has write permissions for the app user
- [ ] `db/products.json` exists with all 24 products
- [ ] `db/users.json` exists with admin account
- [ ] `db/orders.json` exists (can be empty `[]`)
- [ ] DB backup cron job configured (daily recommended)

---

## 🚀 Deployment Platform

- [ ] Server starts cleanly: `GET /health` returns `{"status": "ok"}`
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/products` returns 24 products
- [ ] `GET /` returns HTML page (status 200)
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/auth/login` works with valid credentials
- [ ] Static assets load: `/assets/css/styles.css` returns CSS

---

## 🧪 Final Smoke Tests

Run these immediately after deployment:

```bash
# Health
curl https://yourdomain.com/health

# Products
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/products | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('Products:', d['data']['count'])"

# Homepage
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://yourdomain.com/

# Static CSS
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://yourdomain.com/assets/css/styles.css
```

Expected output:
```
{"status":"ok"}
Products: 24
200
200
```

---

## 📋 Buyer Flow Smoke Test (Manual)

After deployment, test the full buyer flow once manually:

1. Open `https://yourdomain.com`
2. Browse products → confirm 24 load
3. Click a product → select size → Add to Cart
4. Confirm cart drawer opens with item and badge updates
5. Register a new account or log in
6. Go to Checkout → fill form → Place Order (COD)
7. Confirm success screen with TRD-xxxxx order ID
8. Go to Profile → confirm order appears in history
9. Log in as `admin@yourdomain.com` → check admin dashboard
